# Customer Segmentation using K-Means and Streamlit

This project is an end-to-end **Customer Segmentation application** built using **K-Means clustering** and deployed with **Streamlit**.  
It allows users to input customer attributes and receive real-time segment predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Customer segmentation using **unsupervised learning (K-Means)**
- Feature scaling with **StandardScaler**
- Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**
- Real-time cluster prediction
- Production-ready model persistence using **joblib**

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the *Customer Segmentation* dataset from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/customer-segmentation-clustering

Please download the dataset and place it under the `data/` directory if you want to retrain the model.
